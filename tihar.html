      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Tihar, like Dashain, is an extremely important festival in Nepal. It falls during September or October and lasts for 5 days. It is also called the "Festival of Lights". During this festival, the worshipping of various deities occurs. During the first two days, the goddess Laxmi is worshipped, as well as dogs and crows. On the third day, cows are worshipped, and on the fourth day, oxen are worshipped. On the fifth day, tika (coloured powder mixed with other ingredients) is placed by sisters on the foreheads of their brothers, and prayers for blessings and prosperity are said. Homes are beautifully lit up throughout the country during the festival, with candles, lights, and lamps.</p>
