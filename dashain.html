Dashain is the most auspicious and eagerly-awaited festival in Nepal, and is celebrated by Nepalese Hindus all over the world. Family and community values are highly stressed upon during this festival. Many people return to Nepal or their hometowns for the festival, and many businesses, schools, office close during this time. The festival celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the devil Mahishasura. This is done through feasts, gatherings, fairs, and worshipping in the form of prayers and offerings. Dashain's purpose is also to celebrate good harvests and the fertility of the land. On the ninth day of the festival, the magnificent Taleju Temple in Kathmandu's famous Durbar Square becomes open to the public, the only time during the year when Hindus can visit it. The tenth day of Dashain is highly significant, and is known as "tika". On this day, people put rice tika (coloured powder) on their foreheads and wear new clothes. The last day of the festival coincides with the full moon and is known as Kojagrat Purnima. Dashain occurs during September or October</p>
