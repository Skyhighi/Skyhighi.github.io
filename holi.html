      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Holi is one of the most famous festivals in the world. It is widely known for being celebrated in India; however, it is also celebrated in Nepal. It is a vibrant and colourful occasion that lasts for two days. In Nepal, the beginning of Holi is marked by the raising of a wooden bamboo pole in front of the palace. The pole is called "chir" and is decorated with colourful flags and strips of cloth. The pole represents prosperity and good fortune. At night, the pole is burned, which is a symbol of the past year being discarded. As in India, Holi in Nepal includes celebrations in the streets where people spray and splash each other with colourful powders, sprays, and other items. It takes places in February or March.</p>
