      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">This unique festival centres around females. During Teej, both married and unmarried women fast and pray. This is done for their own health, and for the prosperity of their spouses and children. Those who are married pray for their husbands, while those who are unmarried pray for good future spouses. The festival lasts for three days and falls during either August or September. On day one, the women enjoy heavy food, known as "dar khana", before beginning their one-day fast. They fast on the second day too, and on the third day, the fast is broken, and rich foods made with ghee are eaten. Dances, prayer songs, and traditional sweets are hallmarks of this festival.</p>
